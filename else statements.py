# Calvin Coolidgeâ€™s Cool College has another request for you. They want you to add an additional check to a previous if statement. If a student is failing to meet one or both graduation requirements, they want it to print:
credits = 120
gpa = 1.9

if (credits >= 120) and (gpa >= 2.0):
  print("You meet the requirements to graduate!")
else:
  print('You do not meet the requirements to graduate.')
